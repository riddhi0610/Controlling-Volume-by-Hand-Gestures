What it does: This program allows the user to control the volume of their device with specific hand gestures involving their thumb and index finger!

How I built it: This program was coded on PyCharm, OpenCV Python. 

Challenges I ran into: None! The tutorial was highly descriptive and I was able to successfully customize the code according to my liking!

Accomplishments that I am proud of: I am very proud that it works and I was able to understand and learn a lot through this tutorial.

What's next: I hope to create more hand recognition programs like this that can help speak ASL.

Language: Python.
